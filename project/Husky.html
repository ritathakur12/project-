		<h2>History</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 110%;">Siberian Husky breed history begins in the harsh northern landscapes of Russia.<br> As its name suggests, the land of origin of the this breed is Siberia, its northeastern<br> part actually. Siberian semi-nomads called Chukchi were the first people to breed<br> these dogs among them. Endangered by the ongoing climate changes in the 19th<br> century, Chukchis were forced to search for new distant hunting grounds. For that<br> they required very enduring sledge dogs which can cross vast lands in harsh winter<br> climates at a steady tempo – dogs capable to endure very low temperatures on<br> scarce food supplies, with a great sense of orientation. So they developed their own<br> dog breed known by the name Chukchi Sled Dog. First, they’ve done selection of<br> puppies after a month of their lives – only the strongest and fittest are left to see<br> another day. Next selection was done by their ability to pull the sledge. These dogs<br> proved to be not just perfect for all their needs, but also as wonderful family and<br> children’s companions. Although these Chukchi Sled Dogs are to some extent<br> different from purebred Huskies, they have the same DNA and for that reason<br> they’re rightfully known as their predecessors.</p>
