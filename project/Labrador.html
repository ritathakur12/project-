                <p style="font-size: 120%;">Labradors are a medium-large breed of retriever dogs,<br>with dogs typically weighing 29–36 kg (65–80 lb)<br> and bitches 25–32 kg (55–70 lb). Labradors are powerful and<br> indefatigable swimmers noted for their ability to tolerate the<br> coldest of water for extended periods of time.<br> They are also used for pointing and flushing and make<br> excellent upland game hunting partners. Sice they<br> are good swimmers this breed is used in water rescue/lifesaving.</p>

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p style="font-size: 110%;">The Labrador breed dates back to at least the 1830s, when St. Johns Water Dogs bred by European settlers in Newfoundland, were first introduced to Britain from ships trading between Canada and Poole in Dorsetshire. These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create what became known as the Labrador Retriever. Its early patrons included the Earl of Malmesbury, the Duke of Buccleuch, the Earl of Home, and Sir John Scott. Early writers have confused the Labrador with the much larger Newfoundland and the Lesser Newfoundland, with Charles St. John even referring to the Lesser Newfoundland as the Newfoundland. Colonel Peter Hawker describes the first Labrador as being not larger than an English Pointer, more often black than other colours, long in its head and nose with a deep chest, fine legs, and short and smooth coat, and did not carry its tail as highly as the Newfoundland.</p>
